# -M1OEP-Large-mpursche
Max Pursche, Large Project 1

A texas holdem game where you bet on the probability of a set of players winning with a selected players hand
The player will be given 4 different players with different hands of cards
If you guess the winning combination then you get points
if you guess the wrong combination then you lose points

##Future Implementations
I want to add:
- chips and chip counts,
- users being able to initialize a game of players with chips and playing multiple rounds,
- visuals during the graphics portion,
- fleshing out evaluatePlayers() to check for high card of a straight
- the royal flush

##Bugs
- evaluateHand() - has trouble recognising the correct combination of card values with the corresponding hand

##Citations

##Grade Earned
I believe I earned 75 - 80 points on this project.
- Design
The program has 3 objects with non-trivial functions.
There are 7 overloaded operators
There are 3 Enumerated Data Types
There is a struct in Player.h
Main.cpp uses all of the objects
All inputs are validated
- Execution
The Program has a couple hand recognition bugs but otherwise functions completely
- Usability
The Program is user friendly, has a clear purpose and function
All inputs are validated, there is user interaction
I think that the program is quite interesting and I want to use it to improve my poker skills
