# -Texas Holdem by Max Pursche

A texas holdem game where you bet on the probability of a set of players winning with a selected players hand
The user will be given 4 different players with different hands of cards
If you guess the winning combination then you get points
If you guess the wrong combination then you lose points

# Future Implementations
I want to add:
- chips and chip counts,
- users being able to initialize a game of players with chips and playing multiple rounds,
- fleshing out evaluatePlayers() to check for high card of a straight/ flush,
- the royal flush
- Running this using homemade graphics

# Bugs/Functionality Fixes
- evaluateHand() - has trouble recognising the correct combination of card values with the corresponding hand
- The Deck isn't erasing cards properly when utilising them
- The player evaluations aren't accurate
- The Ace is not applying the optimal value if it is a winning combination
